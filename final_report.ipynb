    "\t- Identification variables: fighter names, dates, locations\n",

    "#### The Target\n",
    "\n",
    "What we're trying to predict is the winner of each bout, presented in the train set as the 'Winner' column, with class levels being either 'Red' or 'Blue' (the colors of the corners in the UFC octagon - depending on which corner is whose, the fighter is either classified as a 'Red' fighter or 'Blue' fighter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training, I encoded these values as 0 and 1, with 'Red' being the former. Because there is a disproportionately large number of 'Red' winners, there were more 0's than 1's, and I had to be careful with the fact that features that seem less significant might be skewed towards the 0 side.

I also tried to proportion null values to better suit trends from that particular feature or other related features. Ultimately, however, I found it was best to simply drop the null values entirely, because it didn't affect any of the features' trends or omit a significant amount of information. \n",
